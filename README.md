# TypePulse

## Overview
This is the official repository for **TypePulse**, a type confusion bug detection tool for Rust packages. The details of our work can be found in our paper "TypePulse: Detecting Type Confusion Bugs in Rust Programs", which will appear at the 34th USENIX Security Symposium (USENIX Security '25), August 13â€“15, 2025, at the Seattle, WA, USA.

## Environment Setup
We provide a Dockerfile to facilitate users to quickly deploy and use **TypePulse**. The user also can install TypePulse on the local by following the next steps.

### Requirements
**TypePulse** can be installed on a Linux environment (ubuntu >=18.04). It relies on `rustc` to compile Rust packages. In our evaluation, we use rustc nightly-2023-06-02. In addition, we use Python3 to set up environments and prepare data.

### First time to set up environment
Set up the folder and path for **TypePulse**:
```
python3 setup_typepulse_home.py path/to/your/typepulse_home
```
If you don't install Rust development environment:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
Don't forget to configure the env variables.

Set up `rustc` version, toolchains, and env variables:
```bash
rustup install nightly-2023-06-02
rustup default nightly-2023-06-02         // change to nightly channel which is rustc 1.72.0-nightly
rustup component add rust-src rustc-dev llvm-tools-preview miri

// env var setup
export TYPEPULSE_RUST_CHANNEL=nightly-2023-06-02
export TYPEPULSE_RUNNER_HOME="/home/TypePulse/typepulse-home"
export RUSTFLAGS="-L $HOME/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-2023-06-02-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:$HOME/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-2023-06-02-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib"
export RUSTC_SYSROOT="$HOME/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-2023-06-02-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/rustc"
```
### install with `install.sh`
```
// $0 is bin
cargo install --path "$(dirname $0)" --force
```
You should be able to see the message that `cargo-typepulse` and `typepulse` are installed.

## Usage Tutorial: Run TypePulse in your package
For example, if the user wants to run TypePulse in [candle-core 0.4.1](https://crates.io/crates/candle-core). 
First, they need to download the package source code:
```bash
curl -L 'https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/candle-core/0.4.1/download' > ./candle-core-0.4.1.tar.gz
tar -xvf candle-core-0.4.1.tar.gz
```

Then, enter into the directory of the package (Same level as `Cargo.toml`) :
```bash
cd candle-core-0.4.1/
```

Next, execute **TypePulse**:
```bash
cargo typepulse -j 16
# -j 16 means that we use 16 processes to speed up the detection, and the user can change the number according to the local environment.
```

The detection report:
```bash

        Device::Cuda(cuda) => super::cuda::load_quantized(cuda, data)?,
    };
    super::QTensor::new(data, dims)
}
...
```
In addition to `Error`, we also show the bugs at `Warning` level. However, they are not included in our "Positive" cases.


## Troubleshoot
If you run into the following error message:
```
|ERROR| [typepulse-progress] typepulse was built for a different sysroot than the rustc in your current toolchain.
Make sure you use the same toolchain to run typepulse that you used to build it!
```
The reason could be that the crate specified the different toolchain from the one used by TypePulse. In this case, you could change the `channel` specified in `rust-toolchain.toml` to the one we used if there is no breaking change between two rustc versions.  

### Dependencies issues
To override the specified toolchain of project:  
```
rustup override set nightly-2023-06-02-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

If you run into this `home` issue:
```
error: package `home v0.5.11` cannot be built because it requires rustc 1.81 or newer, while the currently active rustc version is 1.72.0-nightly
```
Considering this command:  
```
cargo update -p home@0.5.11 --precise 0.5.9
```

### Troubleshooting Custom build issues
```
error: failed to run custom build command for openssl-sys v0.9.98

Caused by:
  process didn't exit successfully: /home/crates/sources/scryer-prolog-0.9.4/target/debug/build/openssl-sys-bab20857b695b75c/build-script-main (exit status: 101)
```
Solution:  
```
apt install -y pkg-config libssl-dev
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkgconfig
```  
Solution can be applied to packages such as: `scryer-prolog`.  

## `-Zdisable-inter` option
In our work, we provide the ablation study to compare the performance of interprocedural analysis. You can also disable it with following cmd option:
```
cargo typepulse -- -Zdisable-inter
```

## Benchmark: Clippy
Run Clippy to compare the performance of TypePulse as described in Table 4.  
```
cargo +nightly-2023-06-02 clippy -- -Aclippy::all -W clippy::cast_ptr_alignment -W clippy::unsound_collection_transmute
```
